## Welcome to the deep learning notebooks repository!

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that I worked on while learning about deep learning. The notebooks are organized according to the type of neural network trained and the type of data being used.

To get started with the notebooks:

Make sure you have a Python environment set up and have the required packages installed. The notebooks use Tensorflow, so you'll need to install that as well. You can find instructions for setting up a Tensorflow environment in the official Tensorflow documentation.

Clone the repository to your local machine using git.

Open the notebooks in a Jupyter Notebook environment by running jupyter notebook in the terminal and navigating to the directory where you cloned the repository.

Each notebook contains a series of cells with code and explanations. You can run the cells in a notebook by clicking on them and then clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the screen, or by pressing Shift+Enter.

If you have any questions or run into any issues while working through the notebooks, don't hesitate to ask for help!

I hope you find these notebooks useful as you learn about deep learning. Good luck on your journey!
